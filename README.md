## 🚗 Car Ownership in the Netherlands

Buying, registering, and maintaining a car in the Netherlands involves a structured process:

### 1. Buying a Car
- **New Car**: Purchase directly from a dealership.
- **Used Car**: Purchase from a dealer, private seller, or online platforms (e.g., Marktplaats, Autoscout24).
- **Import Car**: You can import cars from other EU countries, but additional paperwork is required.

### 2. Registration
- Every car must be registered with the **RDW (Rijksdienst voor het Wegverkeer)**.
- Registration provides a **kentekenbewijs (license certificate)**.
- Number plates are yellow with black letters.

### 3. Taxes & Fees
- **BPM (Belasting van Personenauto’s en Motorrijwielen)**: A one-time purchase/import tax (based on CO2 emissions).
- **MRB (Motorrijtuigenbelasting)**: Road tax, depends on fuel type, car weight, and province.
- **VAT (BTW)**: Included in new car purchases.

### 4. Insurance
- Minimum required: **WA (Wettelijke Aansprakelijkheidsverzekering)** = third-party liability.
- Optional:  
  - **WA+ (limited casco)**: theft, fire, glass damage.  
  - **All-risk (volledig casco)**: covers all damages.

### 5. Periodic Inspections
- **APK (Algemene Periodieke Keuring)** = mandatory car inspection for safety and environment.
- Frequency: every 1–2 years, depending on car age and fuel type.
